## Customizing An Environment

Further information on customizing or extending an environment is forthcoming. For now, this section is limited to very simple and somewhat common customizations.

To configure your project with a non-default PHP version, add the following to the project's `.env` file and run `warden env up -d` to re-create the affected containers:

    PHP_VERSION=7.2

The versions of MariaDB, Elasticsearch, Varnish, Redis, NodeJS and Composer may also be similarly configured using variables in the `.env` file:

  * `MARIADB_VERSION`
  * `ELASTICSEARCH_VERSION`
  * `REDIS_VERSION`
  * `VARNISH_VERSION`
  * `RABBITMQ_VERSION`
  * `NODE_VERSION`
  * `COMPOSER_VERSION`

Start of some environments could be skipped by using variables in `.env` file:

  * `WARDEN_DB=0`
  * `WARDEN_REDIS=0`

### Magento 1 Specific Customizations

If you use a `modman` structure, initialize the environment in your project path. 
The `.modman` folder and the corresponding `.basedir` file will be recognized and set up automatically. 

### Magento 2 Specific Customizations

The following variables can be added to the project's `.env` file to enable additional database containers for use with the Magento 2 (Commerce Only) [split-database solution](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/config-guide/multi-master/multi-master.html).

  * `WARDEN_SPLIT_SALES=1`
  * `WARDEN_SPLIT_CHECKOUT=1`

Start of some Magento 2 specific environments could be skipped by using variables in `.env` file:

  * `WARDEN_ELASTICSEARCH=0`
  * `WARDEN_VARNISH=0`
  * `WARDEN_RABBITMQ=0`
